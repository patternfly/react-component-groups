import { Button, Card, CardBody, CardFooter, CardHeader } from '@patternfly/react-core';
import ErrorBoundary from "@patternfly/react-component-groups/dist/dynamic/ErrorBoundary";
import { FunctionComponent, useState } from 'react';

The **error boundary** component repurposes the `<ErrorState>` component for an application error boundary.

## Examples

### Error boundary usage example

A basic error boundary appears when an error is thrown inside of the wrapped content.

The component itself has a `headerTitle`, an `errorTitle`, and shows an en error stack with details.

```js file="./ErrorBoundaryExample.tsx"

```
